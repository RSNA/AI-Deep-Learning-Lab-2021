        "Now we can set up a basic Keras CNN model. We will use the lightweight MobileNetV2 model since our classification problem is relatively simple. Important parameters that can affect model performance include: the initial learning rate (how aggressively the model makes changes to its weights), dropout probability (a method to prevent overfitting by randomly turning neurons in the CNN off), and batch size (the number of images at each iteration to adjust the CNN weights). We use the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimizer that performs well in most cases. We use an image size of 256 x 256. Oftentimes we would see better performance with higher image sizes up to a point, after which increases in image size do not improve or even worsen performance. However, the tradeoff is that you require more GPU memory and training time. \n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing early stopping and a learning rate annealing schedule can help improve performance. A model can quickly overfit and perfectly predict the training data, especially if the model is large and the dataset is small. Early stopping uses validation performance to determine when to stop training: if a model is no longer making improvements on the validation dataset, then stop training. How long we wait and how much progress is considered improvement are both tunable parameters. Reducing the learning rate when validation performance stagnates can also improve model performance. While the initial learning rate should be relatively large to speed up convergence, training using smaller learning rates later on in the process can help the model make smaller adjustments to better fit the specific classification task. In this example, we choose to monitor the validation loss as track changes in the loss to determine when to reduce the learning rate and stop training.\n",
        "\n",
        "We initialize our model with ImageNet pretrained weights. Our dataset is relatively small so training from scratch (randomly initialized weights) will likely result in worse performance and unstable model training. Even with larger datasets, initializing with pretrained weights can speed up model convergence. Because ImageNet is composed of 3-channel RGB natural color images and our CT scout images are 1-channel grayscale images, we need to slightly modify the first layer of the ImageNet pretrained weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that we use binary crossentropy as our loss function versus categorical crossentropy. We previously discussed how our problem is multi-label in that a single image can have multiple labels (e.g., chest AND abdomen). Categorical crossentropy is better suited for multi-class problems where an image has only one label. "

Severe class imbalance can cause problems during training as the network will learn to simply predict the more prevalent class. Two common strategies are 1) over-/under-sampling the data so that the distributions of class labels are more similar and 2) using a weighted loss function that gives more weight to less common classes. Though our data is not severely imbalanced, adjusting for class imbalance can still result in small performance boosts. We will use an inverse-frequency weighted loss function during training."
